## Supply you own word lists

`unamegen` integrates a basic english word list it uses to generate the random words.

You can use your own word list by using the `-i` flag. This allows you to generate words, that sound like other languages.

Lists for some languages can be found in the [dictionaries/](dictionaries/) directory.
